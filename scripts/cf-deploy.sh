# CI deploy wrapper: deploy each branch to the Worker that belongs to it.
#
# Wire it up as the **deploy command** in the Cloudflare Workers Builds
# dashboard (Settings → Build → Deploy command):
#
#     bash scripts/cf-deploy.sh
#
# That one dashboard setting is the whole reason this file exists. Workers
# Builds offers a single deploy command for every branch, so the branch logic
# has to live in a script — the same way `cf-build.sh` carries the branch logic
# for the build.
#
# Behavior:
#   - production branch (default `main`, override with CF_PRODUCTION_BRANCH)
#       → `wrangler deploy`  — the production Worker.
#   - any other branch
#       → `wrangler deploy --env staging`
#         (the deployed staging Worker — the thing that receives queue
#          messages, cron triggers, and every other non-request handler)
#       → `wrangler versions upload --env staging --preview-alias <branch>`
#         (the per-commit preview URL, HTTP only)
#
#     Deploy first, then upload. `versions upload` fails outright against a
#     Worker that doesn't exist yet — "You cannot upload a new version of a
#     Worker that does not yet exist" — which is the state on the very first
#     branch push in a repo. Uploading first would kill this script before the
#     deploy that would have created the Worker.
#   - anywhere else (a developer's terminal) → no-op. Nothing is ever deployed
#     from a laptop.
#
# ── The one thing not to get wrong ────────────────────────────────────────────
# A non-production branch must never land on the production Worker. There are
# two ways the environment gets selected, and using the wrong one fails SILENTLY
# — the deploy succeeds, prints a preview URL, and has overwritten production:
#
#   plain wrangler build  → `--env staging` here, at deploy time.
#   @cloudflare/vite-plugin → `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging` at BUILD time (cf-build.sh
#     sets it). The plugin flattens that environment into a generated config and
#     redirects wrangler at it; Cloudflare's docs state that `--env` on
#     `wrangler deploy` "will have no effect" once that redirect exists.
#
# So the flag is conditional, decided by whether the build left a redirect, and
# it is built once and reused so the two commands below cannot drift apart.
# Whichever path ran, the guard after them re-reads the name wrangler actually
# deployed and aborts if it is production's. That check is the real safety net:
# it catches this whole class of mistake rather than any one instance of it.
#
# Why two commands rather than one: they produce two URLs with different
# capabilities. The version alias serves HTTP for that specific commit; only
# the deployed staging Worker runs queue consumers and crons. See
# wiki/stack/d1-pipeline.md.
#
# Zero-config: no Worker name, environment id, or database id is baked in here.
# The environment is always `staging`; everything else comes from the branch and
# the wrangler config. Every repo ships this file byte-for-byte identical.
