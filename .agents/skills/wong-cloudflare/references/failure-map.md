# Failure map

Cloudflare's API errors are written for people who already know the answer. `10000 Authentication error` is what a correctly-made token returns when one checkbox is missing, and it says nothing about which one.

This page maps what the API returns to **the one thing the user should change**. [The skill](../SKILL.md) uses it to translate; the raw response stays available for an agent to read, but never leads the message.

## The rule

> Say the cause and the fix. Never lead with a code.

```
   ✗ "Provisioning failed: 9109 Unauthorized to access requested resource"

   ✓ "The token can't see your account yet — the Account Resources field
      on the token screen was left unset. You can edit the token you already
      made: set Account Resources to Include → your account, save, and I'll
      re-check. No need to create a new one."
```

## The map

### Token creation

| Symptom | Cause | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /user/tokens/verify` → `1000 Invalid API Token`, but account-scoped calls work | Token was created under **Account → API Tokens**, not **My Profile → API Tokens** | Cloudflare has two token screens; only the profile one works here. Walk them back through the click path. A new token is needed — this one can't be converted. |
| `GET /user` → `9109` | `User Details Read` is missing | Cosmetic — self-verification only. Continue; mention it, don't block. |
| `GET /user/tokens` → `9109` | `API Tokens Write` is missing | The self-widening step can't run. Either add the permission, or fall back to granting the full list by hand. |
| `GET /accounts` → `success: true`, `count: 0` | **Account Resources** was left unset | The most common miss. The existing token can be edited — no new token needed. |
| Any account-scoped call → `10000 Authentication error` | The permission for that surface isn't granted, or the account isn't in scope | If `/accounts` is non-empty, it's a permission; if empty, it's the resources field. Check that order. |

`count: 0` with `success: true` is the tell worth internalizing: Cloudflare reports an out-of-scope account as *no accounts*, not as an error. It reads like an empty account and is actually an unset field.

### Widening

| Symptom | Cause | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| `PUT /user/tokens/{id}` → `4xx` | Malformed policy, or a permission the owner doesn't have | A token can only reach as far as its owner can. If the user isn't a full account admin, the missing permissions must come from someone who is. |
| `PUT` succeeds, re-probe still fails | Propagation, or the group id was wrong | Re-probe once. Still failing → resolve the id by name again and check the `com.cloudflare.api.account` scope. See [permission groups](permission-groups.md#the-two-traps). |
| Widen works, next run can't widen | `API Tokens Write` was dropped from the replaced policy set | Unrecoverable via API — a new token is needed. This is why both original groups must survive every `PUT`. |

### Provisioning

| Symptom | Cause | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| D1 create → name conflict | A database of that name exists | Reuse it if this repo made it; otherwise offer a suffix. Never delete to make room. |
| `wrangler` reports no migrations to apply | `migrations_dir` is resolved relative to the wrangler config, not the repo root | In the `app/` layout it must be `../schema/migrations`. Fails silently — worth checking once. |
| Preview swap refuses to run | `database_id` and `preview_database_id` are identical | Staging was never created, or both slots got the production id. |

### GitHub

| Symptom | Cause | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| Push rejected: `refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow` | The `workflow` OAuth scope is missing | Not in `gh auth login`'s default set. `gh auth refresh --scopes workflow` — a browser consent, a few seconds. Explain it as *"GitHub needs your permission before a tool can add an automated deploy step."* Check for this **before** the first push, not after. |
| `gh secret set` → `HTTP 403` | No admin rights on the repo | Secrets need admin. On someone else's repo, they have to set them. |
| The workflow runs but Cloudflare auth fails | Secrets not set, or set on the wrong repo | `gh secret list` to confirm. The values live in `.env` and are re-settable at any time. |
| A feature branch deployed over production | `CF_PRODUCTION_BRANCH` doesn't match the repo's default branch | The workflow reads it from the repo, so this means the default branch was renamed. Check `cf-deploy.sh`'s log line, which prints both. |

## What not to do

- **Don't retry a permission error.** It will fail identically. Fix the cause.
- **Don't create a second token** when the first can be edited. Editing keeps `.env` correct — the id is stable, so the value already pasted stays valid.
- **Don't paraphrase the dashboard.** "Set the account resources" isn't enough; name the field and the value, in the order they appear on screen.
- **Don't print the token** while debugging. Print its id, which `/user/tokens/verify` returns and which is safe to show.
